# Fall2016Swe573_healthTracker

Bogazici University, SWE 573 Fall 2016 project.
In this project, I will develop a web application solving needs described in the given requirements document:[Project Description](https://github.com/Mephala/Fall2016Swe573_healthTracker/blob/master/SWE573_projectdescription.pdf).

**Project Architecture**

As elicitation of the requirements becomes more clear, I will update [readme file](https://github.com/Mephala/Fall2016Swe573_healthTracker/edit/master/README.md) of my project.

* Server will be written in *Java* as a deployable WAR application, to be deployed on Tomcat Web Container.
* Client-side will be a fully functional html page, client side scripting will be done in *Javascript*.
* As database, I will use *Mysql*.
* For issue tracking, I will constantly update [My Issue Repository](https://github.com/Mephala/Fall2016Swe573_healthTracker/issues)


**Issue Tracking**

Issue tracking will be handled through [My Issue Repository](https://github.com/Mephala/Fall2016Swe573_healthTracker/issues) , I determined issue tags and color codes for issues. Here you can find the basic guidelines of issue categorization:

* Research : Issues regarding to "How to solve project requirements" are handled with this label. Requirements document: [Project Description](https://github.com/Mephala/Fall2016Swe573_healthTracker/blob/master/SWE573_projectdescription.pdf)
* Back-end : When a new feature is needed to be implemented in the back-end, regarding to server programming or Database change.
* bug      : Whenever I notice a bug, issue about a bug is going to be created. After solving root cause of the bug, regarding UI or Back-end issue will be a follow-up.
* UI       : When a new feature or a bugfix is required regarding to *user-interface*, an issue with this label is going to be created.
* TestCase : A TDD as in *Test-Driven Development* issues will be created before actually implementing a feature in the back-end.
* question : No matter how much requirement elicitation has been done, there comes a time when further clarification is required, this is when *question* tagged issue will be created.
